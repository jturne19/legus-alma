## data reduction

1. image prep and imaging for 12m band 7
2. combine band 7 images --> TP + INT
	- feather

## analysis

1. acquire TP image for band 4 (145 GHz, 2.1 mm)
	- emailed Yu Gao, waiting to hear back
2. grab 80% and greater footprint (pbcoverage)
3. use that to do global photometry --> submm excess
4. pick out dust regions and do photometry
5. slope of continuum between 0.87 and 2.1 mm for matching dust regions
6. match dust regions with legus clusters
7. any connection b/w slope and cluster properties?
