# A Joint ALMA-LEGUS Study of Cold Dust Emission and Star Clusters

We present results from a joint ALMA-LEGUS study of NGC628. We combine the LEGUS catalog of over 1000 star clusters in NGC628 with new ALMA millimeter observations of the cold dust continuum. We find excess dust emission at the millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths and then measure the continuum slope -- the effective dust grain emissivity parameter β -- in this regime for a large sample of dust regions. We then track this slope with the local stellar cluster populations as provided by LEGUS to provide insight on the physical processes capable of modifying β. 



## Abstract from Sexten

We present first results from a joint ALMA-LEGUS study of NGC628.  We
combine the LEGUS catalog of over 1000 star clusters in NGC628 with new
ALMA millimeter observations of the cold dust continuum.  These data
help to address the often-observed conundrum of excess dust emission at
submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths, particularly for regions of
low metal abundance.  The excellent resolution of the ALMA
maps--approximately 20 pc at the distance of NGC628--allows us to
constrain the spatial variations in the slope of the cold dust emission
with the ages and masses of the nearby star clusters.
