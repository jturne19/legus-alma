### LEGUS-ALMA paper notes:

An ALMA-HST Study of Cold Dust Emission and Star Clusters
An ALMA-LEGUS Study of Cold Dust Emission and Star Clusters

# intro:
- galaxy SED stuff?
- dust processing
- legus clusters?
- use stuff from danny's original proposals

# observations:
- ALMA 12m band 4
- ALMA 12m and 7m band 7
- 11 hr (?) integrations
- array configurations?
- fields of view slightly offset
- calibration and imaging:
	- casa 4.7.0 calibration and imaging:
		- clean: 
			- check original casa_imaging_script.py for what we did in charlottesville

	- casa 5.1.2 calibration and imaging: 
		- tclean: specmode='mfs', deconvolver='mtmfs', nterms=2, gridder='mosaic'
			- from email from ilsang
			- double check on band 7 maps
- feathered 7m and 12m band 7 images for flux recovery
- legus data --> not sure how much should be said about legus stuff

# methods?:
- global photometry:
	- circular region that fit in 80% pbcoverage of both band 4 and band 7 maps
	- IRAF imcnts
	- same region and imcnts for PACS and SPIRE data
	- fit modified blackbody to PACS,SPIRE data 
		- mcmc fitting if that matters
- identifying dust
	- sextractor to find sources >3 sigma !something to check/play with! over background with 5 contiguous pixels 
	- only kept sources within 80% pbcoverage
	- not confident on sextractor sources because only one source is immediately obvious
	- identified sources that overlapped/matched up in both bands
	- sextractor provides photometry on these regions
	- found slope --> log(y1) - log(y0) / log(x1) - log(x2)
- star cluster--dust matching
	- found distance between each dust region and every cluster within 20" !double check this number!
	- top 3 closest clusters kept
	- the separations between dust and 3 clusters averaged together
	- age of 3 clusters averaged together
- co-dark:
	- archival alma observation of CO(1-0)
	- CPROPS to identify and measure gas clouds
	- measure visible ism mass --> ! double check math!
		- ism mass inferred from alma dust obseverations M_ism = 170x10^6 Msun
		- THINGS 21cm map gives H1 mass M_H1 = 56x10^6 Msun
		- 170x10^6 - 56x10^6 Msun = M_H2 = 95x10^6 Msun
		- ALMA CO map gives an H2 mass M_H2 = 61x10^6 Msun
		- 61x10^6 / 95x10^6 = 0.64 --> fraction of CO we can see 
		- CO-Dark fraction = 36%
# results and discussion:
- submm/mm excess
	- excess of emission at 2.1 mm above the extrapolation from herschel data
	- free-free and synchrotron cannot account for this excess
- star cluster--dust separation
	- younger star clusters closer to dust
	- similar results as Grasha+2018 for NGC7793 and SC--GMC separation
- continuum slope vs sc age
	- no correlation 
- co-dark
	- 36%
	- does this agree with simulations: MW (Smith+2014) and GMCs (Wolfire+2010)
	- does this agree with observations: MW survey (Langer+2014)
